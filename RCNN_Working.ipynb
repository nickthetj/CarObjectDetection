    "## Overview\n",
    "Object recognition is the linchpin for self-driving cars. It enables self-driving cars to identify and respond to objects like pedestrians and vehicles in real-time, ensuring safer autonomous driving. This notebook will walk through one of three object detection models that can identify and draw bounding-boxes around cars on the road: YOLOv8, R-CNN, and Bounding Box Regression (BB). The YOLOv8 model was implemented with the pre-packaged model from Ultralytics, and R-CNN and BB were built from the ground up. We will walk through differences between each model on a conceptual level, their implementation and respective evaluation scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "These object detection models were developed as a tool for autonomous vehicles and traffic safety cameras to enable the cameras to perceive and understand its environment by identifying and locating objects of interest in real-time. Specifically in identifying and locating where cars are in a picture."
